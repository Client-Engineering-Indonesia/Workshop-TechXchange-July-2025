<h1 id="section3">3. Curate and Enrich Data Assets</h1>

Curation can be a **very labor intensive and time consuming process** and for a lot of organizations it's mostly done manually where data assets are curated one at a time. Advanced data curation, which is included with Knowledge Catalog, and what you will use in this lab, is primarily an automated process where many of the curation tasks are completed automatically, without human intervention, for one to may data assets simultaneously.

#### 1. Create the Enrichment Project
This step creates the project that will be used to create and execute the automated `Metadata import` and `Metadata enrichment` tools to discover, add, and curate the data assets needed by the analytics project team before they are published to the governed `Business` catalog.

Goals: 
- [ ] Create a project in Data Studio
- [ ] Manage access control
- [ ] Adjust project settings

Steps:
1. Select the `Navigation` menu (the 4 stacked horizontal lines in the upper left corner).

5. In the `Description` field put `This project is used to import and enrich the metadata for the data assets that will be published to the Business catalog that will be accessible to the analytics project team for analytics and AI tasks`.
6. Click the `Create` button
![section5_4](https://cp4d-outcomes.techzone.ibm.com/img/data-fabric-lab/knowledge-catalog/image62.png)

When the project creation is complete the project will open up to the `Overview` section of the project.

#### 2. Adjust Project Settings
For this lab, the **metadata enrichment** `Term assignment` settings that are used by `Knowledge Catalog` to automatically assign business terms will be adjusted. 

Steps: 

1. Click the `Manage` tab.
2. Select the `Metadata enrichment` settings project menu.
3. Scroll down until the `Term assignment` settings are at the top of the page.
4. In the `Term assignment` methods to use area, clear the `Machine learning` and `Data-class-based assignments check boxes`. The only method that will be used and that wil remain selected is `Name matching`.
5. In the `Select assets` used for training built in model and adjustment area, select the `From Project` radio button.
6. Click the `Assets` tab.
