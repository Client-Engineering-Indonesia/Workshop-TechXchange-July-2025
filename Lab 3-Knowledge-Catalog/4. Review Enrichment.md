<h1 id="section3">4. Review Enrichment Results</h1>
Based on the enrichment scope and objectives, the Metadata enrichment tool automatically profiled the data, analyzed and assessed data quality, assigned and suggested business terms, and assigned data classes to all columns for the data assets included in the metadata enrichment job.

#### 1. Review Asset Enrichment
This step reviews the Metadata enrichment results at the Asset level.

![section11_1](https://cp4d-outcomes.techzone.ibm.com/img/data-fabric-lab/knowledge-catalog/image110.png)

Data quality is very accurate in the latest version of Knowledge Catalog and provides the ability to drill down into the data quality analysis details to determine what is contributing to the overall quality score. Let's investigate what is contributing to the EMPLOYEE asset's 99.7% data quality score.

Steps: 
1. Hover over the `EMPLOYEE` data quality score, click on the `99.7%` score.
![section11_2](https://cp4d-outcomes.techzone.ibm.com/img/data-fabric-lab/knowledge-catalog/image111.png)
2. Click the `Columns` button.
3. Click the `Score` column header to sort in descending order (arrow pointing up).
![section11_3](https://cp4d-outcomes.techzone.ibm.com/img/data-fabric-lab/knowledge-catalog/image112.png)

Scroll `down`to view all the columns. There are `5` columns contributing to the low data quality score. In the interest of time we won't look at all of the columns but we will drill down into data quality details of just the `EXTENSION` column which has the lowest data quality score to demonstrate how to view the data quality details for a column.

4. Click the `EXTENSION` column that has the lowest data quality score.
![section11_4](https://cp4d-outcomes.techzone.ibm.com/img/data-fabric-lab/knowledge-catalog/image113.png)
5. Scroll `down` to the Data quality checks section, Click the `Percentage of data with issues` column header to sort in descending order (arrow pointing down).
6. Select the `X` in the upper right corner of the dialog to close it.
![section11_5](https://cp4d-outcomes.techzone.ibm.com/img/data-fabric-lab/knowledge-catalog/image114.png)
7. Select the `X` in the upper right corner of the dialog to close it.
![section11_6](https://cp4d-outcomes.techzone.ibm.com/img/data-fabric-lab/knowledge-catalog/image115.png)

#### 2. Assign Asset Terms
This step assigns business terms at the `Asset` level. Knowledge Catalog considers suggested business terms as missing until one of the suggested business terms has been accepted. Based on the metadata enrichment results, no business terms were suggested at the asset level so new terms will be assigned. The data asset business term assignments will be assigned as follows:

| Data Assets | Business Terms Assigned |
| --- | ---  |
| Employee| Employee Code, Email Address, SSN |
| Warehouse Staff | Employee Code, Skill Experience, Skill Rating, Skill Set |

##### Assign EMPLOYEE Terms

Steps: 
1. Hover over the `Business Terms` column of the `EMPLOYEE` asset, click the `View more` link that appears.
2. Click the `+` sign in the `Business terms` section of the `Governance` tab.
![section12_1](https://cp4d-outcomes.techzone.ibm.com/img/data-fabric-lab/knowledge-catalog/image116.png)
3. Select the checkbox next to the `Email Address` business term.
4. Select the checkbox next to the `Employee Code` business term.
![section12_2](https://cp4d-outcomes.techzone.ibm.com/img/data-fabric-lab/knowledge-catalog/image117.png)
5. Using the `search area`, enter the letters `ssn`.
6. Select the checkbox next to the `SSN` business term.
7. Click the `Assign` button.
![section12_3](https://cp4d-outcomes.techzone.ibm.com/img/data-fabric-lab/knowledge-catalog/image118.png)

#### Assign WAREHOUSE_STAFF.csv Terms
1. Hover over the `Business Terms` column of the `WAREHOUSE_STAFF.csv` asset, click the `View more` link that appears.
2. Click the `+` sign in the `Business terms` section of the `Governance` tab.
![section12_3](https://cp4d-outcomes.techzone.ibm.com/img/data-fabric-lab/knowledge-catalog/image119.png)
3. Select the checkbox next to the `Employee Code` business term.
![section12_4](https://cp4d-outcomes.techzone.ibm.com/img/data-fabric-lab/knowledge-catalog/image120.png)
4. Using the `search area`, enter the word `skill`.
5. Select the checkbox next to the `Skill Rating` business term.
6. Select the checkbox next to the `Skill Set` business term.
7. Select the checkbox next to the `Skill Experience` business term.
8. Click the `Assign` button.
![section12_5](https://cp4d-outcomes.techzone.ibm.com/img/data-fabric-lab/knowledge-catalog/image121.png)

##### Mark Assets as Reviewed
This completes the modifications that will be done at the `Asset` level so the enrichment status of the data assets can be set to `Reviewed`. A meaningful and useful set of business terms are now assigned to all of the data assets that will provide additional information to help end users understand their content.

1. Select the `X` in the top corner of the information panel to close it and gain more screen real estate.
2. Select the `high level` checkbox to select all assets.
![section12_6](https://cp4d-outcomes.techzone.ibm.com/img/data-fabric-lab/knowledge-catalog/image122.png)
3. Select the `More` action menu on the toolbar.
4. Select then `Mark as reviewed` action.
![section12_7](https://cp4d-outcomes.techzone.ibm.com/img/data-fabric-lab/knowledge-catalog/image123.png)
5. Click the `Done` button.
![section12_8](https://cp4d-outcomes.techzone.ibm.com/img/data-fabric-lab/knowledge-catalog/image124.png)
6. Click the `Refresh` button in the top right corner of the message displayed.
![section12_9](https://cp4d-outcomes.techzone.ibm.com/img/data-fabric-lab/knowledge-catalog/image125.png)
All of the `Assets` now have a `checkmark` next to them in the `Review status` column indicating that they have been reviewed.
![section12_10](https://cp4d-outcomes.techzone.ibm.com/img/data-fabric-lab/knowledge-catalog/image126.png)

#### 3. Review Column Enrichment
This step reviews the `Metadata enrichment` results at the `Column` level.

1. Click the Columns tab.
2. Click the Data quality column header to sort the columns in descending order (Arrow pointing up) until the EXTENSION column is at the top of the list.

Data quality at the column level looks excellent with a few exceptions. Five columns: `EXTENSION, COMMUTE_TIME`, `EMAIL`, `LAST_NAME` and `LAST_NAME_MB` have a data quality score of `99.x%`. The remaining `17` columns have a data quality score of `100%`. Scroll `down` the list of columns to review the data quality score for all the columns.
![section13_11](https://cp4d-outcomes.techzone.ibm.com/img/data-fabric-lab/knowledge-catalog/image127.png)

Scroll `up` to the first column at the top of the column list.

3. Click the `Columns` column header to sort the columns in ascending order (Arrow pointing up) until `BIRTH_DATE` is the first column at the top.
![section13_12](https://cp4d-outcomes.techzone.ibm.com/img/data-fabric-lab/knowledge-catalog/image128.png)

Scroll `down` the list of `22` columns to review the following business term and data class observations:

`22` columns `(100%)` were assigned the correct business term. The `100%` assignment rate was due to the changes that were made earlier to the `Metadata` enrichment term assignment settings. This is outstanding and means that no additional work needs to be done rectifying business term assignments!

However, `17` columns `(77%)` were assigned a data class but only `12` of them `(70%)` were assigned the `correct` data class, which is not bad for a first pass, and the `EMAIL` and `SSN` columns, that are protected by data protection rules, that are based on data class, were assigned the correct data class! `6` columns `(27%)` were `not` assigned a data class.

![section13_12](https://cp4d-outcomes.techzone.ibm.com/img/data-fabric-lab/knowledge-catalog/image129.png)

This is valuable information for the data steward. It validates the accuracy and completeness of the business vocabulary. As stated earlier, the more time and effort invested up front building out a well defined and accurate business vocabulary the better the outcomes will be during the metadata enrichment data curation process

#### 4. Rectify Column Data Classes
This step rectifies the incorrect and missing data class assignments. There are `12` columns with correct data class assignments, leaving 10 that need attention. The `Filer` and `Search` capabilities of metadata enrichment will be used to accomplish this quickly. Having correct data class assignments is essential for columns that contain sensitive information, because there might be data protection rules that are dependent on a column's data class assignment to mask the data. Fortunately, the `EMAIL` and `SSN` columns of the `EMPLOYEE` data asset, that are protected by data protection rules, have already been assigned the correct data class!

The column data class assignments will be rectified as follows:

| Data Class Assigned| Data Asset | Column(s) |
| --- | ---  | ---    |
| Text | EMPLOYEE | EXTENSION, FAX, LAST_NAME_MB, WORK_PHONE   |
|  | WAREHOUSE_STAFF | DAYS_OFF, PAY_RATE, SKILL_EXPERIENCE, SKILL_SET |
| Identifier | EMPLOYEE | EMPLOYEE_CODE |
|  | WAREHOUSE_STAFF | EMPLOYEE_CODE |
| Quantity | WAREHOUSE_STAFF | COMMUTE_TIME |
