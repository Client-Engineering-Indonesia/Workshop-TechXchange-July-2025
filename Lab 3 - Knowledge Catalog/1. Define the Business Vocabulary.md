<h1 id="section1">1. Define the Business Vocabulary</h1>
This section creates the category and business term governance artifacts needed to establish a business ready governance foundation. Knowledge Catalog can use a pre-defined CSV file to import and create the business terms.

It is essential to establish the business vocabulary first before any data curation, enrichment and cataloging of data assets takes place. This is because governance artifacts, like data classes and business terms, can be automatically assigned to data assets during metadata enrichment and cataloging. If not, all of those tasks would have to be done manually, which defeats taking advantage of the automated and built-in data governance capabilities of Knowledge Catalog.

#### 1. Create Categories
Categories act as folders or directories to organize governance artifacts and provide access controls to authorize who can author and manage those artifacts. Categories provide the logical structure for all governance artifacts, except data protection rules. You group governance artifacts in categories to make them easy to find and manage, and to control their visibility. Categories can be organized in a hierarchy based on their meaning and relationships to one another. A category can have subcategories, but a subcategory can have only one direct parent category.

In this section, one category will be created that will provide the logical structure for the governance artifacts defined in this lab.

Goal: 
- [ ] Create categories 

Steps: 
1. Select the Navigation menu (the 4 stacked horizontal lines in the upper left corner).

6. Open the `Advanced settings` section. Under `Access controls`, set the `Allow reporting on governance artifacts` switch to `On`.

7. Click the Create button.

The new category is created and opened for review with the `Name`, `Description` and `Reporting` access control setting that was supplied during creation.

#### 2. Create Business Terms
Business terms can reference data classes and classifications and can be referenced in governance and data protection rules so they need to be imported after data classes and classifications but before importing or creating governance or data protection rules. Business terms can also be related to other business terms so they must be imported in a specific order. The business terms in the CSV file provided are in the correct order to establish these relationships.

This is a significant time saver that runs in minutes. ***Doing this manually would take a data steward hours or days.***

Goals:
- [ ] Create categories by importing the CSV file containing the list of categories.

Steps:
1. Select the Navigation menu (the 4 stacked horizontal lines in the upper left corner).
