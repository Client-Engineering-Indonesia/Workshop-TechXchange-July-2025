<h1 id="section1">1. Define the Business Vocabulary</h1>
This section creates the category and business term governance artifacts needed to establish a business ready governance foundation. Knowledge Catalog can use a pre-defined CSV file to import and create the business terms.

It is essential to establish the business vocabulary first before any data curation, enrichment and cataloging of data assets takes place. This is because governance artifacts, like data classes and business terms, can be automatically assigned to data assets during metadata enrichment and cataloging. If not, all of those tasks would have to be done manually, which defeats taking advantage of the automated and built-in data governance capabilities of Knowledge Catalog.

#### 1. Create categories
Categories act as folders or directories to organize governance artifacts and provide access controls to authorize who can author and manage those artifacts. Categories provide the logical structure for all governance artifacts, except data protection rules. You group governance artifacts in categories to make them easy to find and manage, and to control their visibility. Categories can be organized in a hierarchy based on their meaning and relationships to one another. A category can have subcategories, but a subcategory can have only one direct parent category.

In this section, one category will be created that will provide the logical structure for the governance artifacts defined in this lab.
